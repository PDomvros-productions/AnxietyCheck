            PTSD: { name: "Post-Traumatic Stress", description: "This profile suggests patterns of re-experiencing a past traumatic event through flashbacks or nightmares, avoiding reminders of the event, and feeling constantly 'on edge' or easily startled. These feelings persist long after the traumatic event has passed." },
            OCD: { name: "Obsessive-Compulsive", description: "This profile indicates a pattern of unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and a strong urge to perform certain repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) to relieve anxiety. These rituals can be time-consuming and interfere with daily life." },
            SOCIAL_PHOBIA: { name: "Social Phobia", description: "This profile suggests intense fear and anxiety related to social situations where you might be judged or scrutinised by others. This can lead to avoiding social gatherings, public speaking, or even one-on-one interactions." },
            PANIC_DISORDER: { name: "Panic Disorder", description: "This profile is characterised by recurrent, unexpected panic attacksâ€”sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, or a feeling of impending doom. There is often a persistent fear of having another attack." },
            SEPARATION_ANXIETY: { name: "Separation Anxiety", description: "This profile points to excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom you are attached. This can manifest as worry about harm coming to loved ones or reluctance to be alone." },
            GAD: { name: "Generalized Anxiety", description: "This profile suggests a pattern of excessive, uncontrollable worry about a wide range of everyday things, like health, work, or finances. This worry is often disproportionate to the actual situation and is difficult to manage." },
            AGORAPHOBIA: { name: "Agoraphobia", description: "This profile indicates a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available if you have a panic attack. This can lead to avoiding open spaces, crowds, public transport, or being outside the home alone." },
            SPECIFIC_PHOBIAS: { name: "Specific Phobias", description: "This profile suggests an intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation, such as spiders, heights, or flying. Exposure to the feared item provokes an immediate anxiety response." },
            SELECTIVE_MUTISM: { name: "Selective Mutism", description: "This profile is characterised by a consistent failure to speak in specific social situations where there is an expectation to speak (like at school or work), despite being able to speak in other, more comfortable settings." },
            ACUTE_STRESS: { name: "Acute Stress", description: "Similar to PTSD, this profile involves significant anxiety and distress immediately following a traumatic event. The symptoms last for a shorter period, typically from three days to one month after the trauma." },
            HYPOCHONDRIA: { name: "Illness Anxiety (Hypochondria)", description: "This profile suggests a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. Despite medical reassurance, the fear persists, and you may frequently check your body for signs of illness or avoid doctors for fear of what they might find." },
            BDD: { name: "Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)", description: "This profile indicates a preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in your physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. This causes significant distress and can lead to repetitive behaviours like mirror checking or excessive grooming." }
